    "# **What is Data Structures?** \n",
    "\n",
    "## **A data structures is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Why need Data Structures?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data structures are needed to efficiently organize, store, and manipulate data, which improves a program's performance, speed, and memory utilization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Types of Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Primitive Vs Non-Primitive Data Structures** \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Primitive Data Structures:** \n",
    "#### These are basics, fundamental data types directly supported by a programming language. Examples: `int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`, `complex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Primitive Data Structures:** \n",
    "#### These are more complex data structures derived from primitive data structures and used to store collection of data items. They focus on organizing and managing groups of data. Examples: `Arrays`, `Linked Lists`, `Stack`, `Queues`, `Trees`, `Graphs`, `Hash Tables`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Linear Vs Non-Linear Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Linear Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Linear Data Structures, data elements are arranged in **sequentially** or in a **linear order**, one after another. Examples: `Array`, `LinkedLists`, `Stack`, `Queues`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Linear Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Linear Data Structures, data elements are not arranged in **sequentially**. They represents hierarchial or networked relationships where an elements can be connected to multiple or other elements. Examples: `Trees`, `Graphs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Static Vs Dynamic Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Static Data Structures:** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Have a **fixed memory size** that is allocated at a compile time and can't be changed during runtime. Examples: `Array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Data Structures:** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Have a **flexible memory size** that can be adjusted (increased or decreased) during runtime. Examples: `Linked Lists`, `Trees`, `Graphs`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Homogeneous Vs Non-Homogeneous Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Homogeneous Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Store data elements of the **same data type.** Examples: an array of integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Homogeneous Data Structures:** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can store data elements of **different data types.** Examples: a referential array which contains different types of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **Application of Data Structures** \n",
    "### 1. Database Management System (DBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data structures like B-trees, hash tables, and indexed sequential access methods (ISAM) are crucial for efficient data storage, indexing, and retrieval in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Operating Systems \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Operating systems utilize data structures like queues for process scheduling, stacks for managing function calls and memory allocation, and linked lists for managing file systems and free memory blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compiler Design \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compilers employ data structures such as symbol tables to store information about variables and functions, abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to represent the structure of source code, and hash tables for efficient symbol lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Computer Graphics \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Data structures like trees (e.g., k-d trees, octrees) and graphs are used to represent and manipulate geometric objects, manage spatial data, and optimize rendering processes in computer graphics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Networking \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Graphs are extensively used to model network topologies, represent routing paths, and implement routing algorithms. Queues are used for managing data packets in network communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Data structures like decision trees are used for classification and regression tasks. Graphs are used to represent relationships in knowledge graphs and neural networks. Hash tables are used for efficient data storage and retrieval in various AI algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Navigation Systems \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graphs are used to represent road networks, and algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* search, often implemented with priority queues, are used to find optimal routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. File Systems \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Data structures like trees (e.g., directory trees) and linked lists (e.g., for file allocation tables) are used to organize and manage files and directories on storage devices.\n"

    "- **Simple to implement:** The divide-and-conquer approach is straightforward.\n",
    "- **Naturally Parallel :** We independently merge subarrays that makes it suitable for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:** Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process.\n",
    "- **Not in-place:** Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it requires additional memory to store the sorted data. This can be a disadvantage in applications where memory usage is a concern.\n",
    "- Merge Sort is Slower than QuickSort in general as QuickSort is more cache friendly because it works in-place.\n"

    "### Complexity Analysis of Quick Sort\n",
    "#### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Best Case: (Œ©(n log n)), Occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.\n",
    "- Average Case (Œ∏(n log n)), On average, the pivot divides the array into two parts, but not necessarily equal.\n",
    "- Worst Case: (O(n¬≤)), Occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (e.g., sorted arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Auxiliary Space:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worst-case scenario: O(n) due to unbalanced partitioning leading to a skewed recursion tree requiring a call stack of size O(n).\n",
    "- Best-case scenario: O(log n) as a result of balanced partitioning leading to a balanced recursion tree with a call stack of size O(log n\n",

    "### Advantages of Quick Sort\n",
    "- It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that makes it easier to solve problems.\n",
    "- It is efficient on large data sets.\n",
    "- It has a low overhead, as it only requires a small amount of memory to function.\n",
    "- It is Cache Friendly as we work on the same array to sort and do not copy data to any auxiliary array.\n",
    "- Fastest general purpose algorithm for large data when stability is not required.\n",
    "-  It is tail recursive and hence all the tail call optimization can be done.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Disadvantages of Quick Sort\n",
    "- It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.\n",
    "- It is not a good choice for small data sets.\n",
    "- It is not a stable sort, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order will not be preserved in the sorted output in case of quick sort, because here we are swapping elements according to the pivot's position (without considering their original positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Quick Sort\n",
    "- Sorting large datasets efficiently in memory.\n",
    "- Used in library sort functions (like C++ std::sort and Java Arrays.sort for primitives).\n",
    "- Arranging records in databases for faster searching.\n",
    "- Preprocessing step in algorithms requiring sorted input (e.g., binary search, two-pointer techniques).\n",
    "- Finding the kth smallest/largest element using Quickselect (a variant of quicksort).\n",
    "- Sorting arrays of objects based on multiple keys (custom comparators).\n",
    "- Data compression algorithms (like Huffman coding preprocessing).\n",
    "- Graphics and computational geometry (e.g., convex hull algorithms)."
